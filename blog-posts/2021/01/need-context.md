# We all need some context now and then

With more and more keyboards slowly phasing out the context key (also known as the menu key) I found it more and more frustrating every time I navigated through the Windows file explorer and wanted to quickly press the context key and either view a files properties or open the folder in a new window.

While there are often still two Alt keys on keyboards but only one Ctrl key, or an Fn key taking up valuable bottom-row key space, it seems the poor old context key no longer has a future on our keyboard's bottom row. 

Fear not!

Pressing **Shift + F10** will have the context menu pop up wherever the contextual focus is, just like the good old days of pressing the dedicated context menu key.

While not as simple as a single key press, pressing the **Shift + F10** key combo is significantly better than reaching for the mouse; especially when you are in the middle of a keyboard-heavy workflow.
